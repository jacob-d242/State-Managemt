What is Use Memo?

UseMemo is a React Hook that allows you to memoize a value. It can be used to improve a component's performance by avoiding unnecessary re-computation of values. Its first argument is a function that returns the value to be memoized, and its second argument is an array of dependencies. If one of the dependencies changes, the hook will only recompute the value.

If at least one of the dependencies has changed, the function passed to useMemo is called. If none of the dependencies have changed, the hook will return the previously rendered memoized value. This can be very useful for improving the performance of a component that performs costly calculations, such as deep object comparisons, mathematical calculations, or API calls.

It's also worth noting that useMemo doesn't change the behavior of the component; it simply improves its performance. It's not required, but it's a good idea to use it when you have a component that requires expensive computation and don't want to recompute it on every render.

It is critical to be aware of what you are memoizing and what dependencies you are passing, as passing too many or the incorrect dependencies can result in unexpected behavior. It's also critical to ensure that the value you're memoizing isn't a new object on every render, as this will prevent the previous and next states from being compared, resulting in unnecessary re-renders.
