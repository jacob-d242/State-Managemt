# State Management in React

# 

*In React, state refers to a component's internal data. State management is the process of managing the state of a component used to store data that can be used to determine the output of the component. The state can be changed by interacting with the component, such as by clicking a button or filling out a form.*
 *There are several types of state that you may need to manage in a React app. These include:*
***Local state:*** *This refers to the state that is specific to a single component and is not shared with other components. Local state is often used to store data that is only relevant to the component and does not need to be accessed by other parts of the app.*
***Global state:*** *is often used to refer to the application state that is shared across multiple components. This type of state is typically stored in a central location, such as a store using a library like Redux, and is accessed by all components that need it.*
*In general, it's a good idea to try to minimize the amount of global state in your app, as too much global state can make it difficult to understand the relationships between different parts of your app and can make it harder to maintain and test your code. Instead, it's often better to try to encapsulate the state as locally as possible, and only lift the state to a global level when it is truly needed by multiple components.*
*That being said, certain types of data are naturally global and are therefore well-suited to being stored in a global state. Examples might include the currently logged-in user, the current theme, or the language preference for the app.*
**S*****erver state*** *refers to data that is stored on a server and is used to manage the behavior of the app. This data is typically accessed by the client (the React app) through API calls or other forms of communication with the server.*
*React apps can use server state in a variety of ways. For example, a React app might use server state to:*

1. *Store user data such as login information and profile details*
2. *Persist application data such as settings or preferences*
3. *Enforce security rules and policies around access to data and functionality*
4. *Store data that is too large or complex to be stored in the client-side app (such as a large dataset that is being used to populate a chart or other visualization)*

*It's important to carefully consider how you will manage the server state in your React app, as the way you choose to store and access data on the server can have a significant impact on the overall performance and architecture of your app.*
***URL state*** *refers to data that is stored in the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and is used to determine the behavior of the app. This can include data such as the current page being viewed, search parameters, or other types of data that are needed to support the functionality of the app.*
*URL state is important because it allows users to bookmark or share specific pages or views within an app, and it allows the app to maintain its state even if the page is refreshed or the app is closed and reopened.*
*In a React app, the URL state is typically managed using the* ***useParams*** *hook in conjunction with the* ***useHistory*** *hook from the react-router-dom library. The* ***useParams*** *hook allows you to access the parameters that are passed in the URL, while the* ***useHistory*** *hook allows you to update the URL by pushing new entries onto the history stack.*
*By using these tools, you can create React apps that support deep linking (linking to specific pages or views within the app) and that maintain their state when the URL changes.*


## *There are a few different ways to manage state in a React application:*

*Class-based components have a state property that stores data that determines the output of the component. The State property is initialized in the constructor and can be modified using the* ***setState()*** *method, which triggers a re-render of the component to reflect the updated state.*
*The* ***useState*** *hook allows functional components to have stated. It takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it.*
*State management libraries like* ***Redux*** *or* ***MobX*** *provide a global store for managing the state and offer tools for updating and retrieving the state from the store.*
*State can be passed down through props from a higher-level component to a lower-level component that needs access to it.*
