__State Management in React__

In React, state refers to a component's internal data. State management is the process of managing the state of a of a component is used to store data that can be used to determine the output of the component. The state can be changed by interacting with the component, such as by clicking a button or filling out a form.
There are a few different ways to manage state in a React application:

Class-based components have a state property that stores data that determines the output of the component. The state property is initialized in the constructor and can be modified using the `setState()` method, which triggers a re-render of the component to reflect the updated state.

The `useState` hook allows functional components to have state. It takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it.

State management libraries like Redux or MobX provide a global store for managing state and offer tools for updating and retrieving state from the store.

State can be passed down through props from a higher-level component to a lower-level component that needs access to it.
